> The worlds (easiest*) markdowniest presentation tool

A web app designed to make presentations. Currently it's just rendered markdown as slides, but more to come I guess.

--- 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `docker compose up [-d] [--build]` to start the server, `-d` to daemonize and `--build` to build/rebuild
  * ~~Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`~~

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
